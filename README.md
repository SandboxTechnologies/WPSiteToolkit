WPSiteToolkit
=============

A script to aid migration and other aspects of a Wordpress install.

The WPSiteToolkit differs from other migration/helper scripts in that it uses the Wordpress database settings already on the host site. This helps to reduce the amount of configuration required and focuses more on features.
